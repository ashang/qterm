! Add a tabBar menu, put items like "close", "close  others"
! Configure shortcuts
! Consider how to deal with checkable actions, e.g. actionAuto_Copy. Their
  states need to be recorded and shared among child windows. Either make
  it global accessible, or pass its signal to all proper childs(i.e. 
  localized to child) 

# Frame passes actions to desired child window
# When switch between different windows, visible/invisible
  proper/improper actions based on window type.
